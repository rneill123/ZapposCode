<p>The zombie apocalypse is a rough and scary time.  Most of us with our cushy day jobs in offices  are not prepared for what we are going to have to do to survive when zombies  are trying to eat our brains. Sure you think you are bad ass and prepared because  you play BF3 and have watched the Living Dead on TV.  The reality is when the zombies are amongst  us you will need to do things you never imagined just to survive.  Only the sickest among us will actually enjoy  hacking the brains out of what used to be normal humans.  Just in case you are normal and don&rsquo;t wake up  everyday hoping today will be the day that your annoying neighbor turns into a  zombie so you can cut his head off without fear of going to jail this website  will help you prepare for the coming zombie apocalypse.  </p>
